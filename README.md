Approximates Pi using a simple Monte Carlo method.
User can adjust accuracy by controlling how many samples are taken before the final calculation.

A Monte Carlo method is any algorithm that draws random samples over and over again to do some sort of computation. It's a great family of tools when you need to, for instance, optimize something or create a probability distribution.
For info on Monte Carlo methods, this is a nice jumping-off point:
